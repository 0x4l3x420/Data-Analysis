# What is data anonymization?
Personally identifiable information, or PII, is information that can be used by itself or with other data to track down a person's identity. 

Data anonymization is the process of protecting people's private or sensitive data by eliminating that kind of information. Typically, data anonymization involves blanking, hashing, or masking personal information, often by using fixed-length codes to represent data columns, or hiding data with altered values.
