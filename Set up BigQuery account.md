Whether you're working with public datasets, running SQL queries, or uploading your own data, BigQueryâ€™s SQL workspace offers a range of features to support all kinds of data analysis tasks. Throughout this program, you will be using BigQuery to practice your SQL skills, so being familiar with the major components of your BigQuery console will help you navigate it effectively in the future!

BigQuery offers multiple account options. Keep the following in mind when you choose an account type:

Account tiers: BigQuery provides various account tiers to cater to a wide range of user requirements. Whether you're starting with a sandbox account or exploring a paid account with the free-of-charge trial option, BigQuery offers flexibility to choose the option that aligns best with your needs and budget.

Sandbox limitations: While a sandbox account is a great starting point, it comes with some limitations, such as a cap on the number of projects and restrictions on data manipulation operations like inserting or updating records, which you will encounter later in this program. Be aware of these limitations if you choose to work through this course using a sandbox account.

Easy setup and upgrades: Getting started with any BigQuery account type is quick and easy. And if your needs evolve, you have the flexibility to modify your account status at any time. Additionally, projects can be retained even when transitioning between account types.
