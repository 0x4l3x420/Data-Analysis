# BigQuery account options
BigQuery offers a variety of account tiers to cater to various user needs and has two free-of-charge entry points, a sandbox account and a free-of-charge trial account. These options allow you to explore the program before selecting the best choice to suit your needs.
BigQuery offers multiple account options. Keep the following in mind when you choose an account type:

Account tiers: BigQuery provides various account tiers to cater to a wide range of user requirements. Whether you're starting with a sandbox account or exploring a paid account with the free-of-charge trial option, BigQuery offers flexibility to choose the option that aligns best with your needs and budget.

Sandbox limitations: While a sandbox account is a great starting point, it comes with some limitations, such as a cap on the number of projects and restrictions on data manipulation operations like inserting or updating records, which you will encounter later in this program. Be aware of these limitations if you choose to work through this course using a sandbox account.

Easy setup and upgrades: Getting started with any BigQuery account type is quick and easy. And if your needs evolve, you have the flexibility to modify your account status at any time. Additionally, projects can be retained even when transitioning between account types.
