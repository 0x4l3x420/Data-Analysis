# Data Analysis Process
 * Ask: business challenge, objective, or question

 * Prepare: data generation, collection, storage, and data management

 * Process: data cleaning and data integrity

 * Analyze: data exploration, visualization, and analysis

 * Share: communicating and interpreting results 

 * Act:  putting  insights to work to solve the problem

## EMC's data analysis process
 EMC Corporation's data analytics process is cyclical with six steps:

 * Discovery

 * Pre-processing data

 * Model planning

 * Model building

 * Communicate results

 * Operationalize

## SAS's iterative process
An iterative data analysis process was created by a company called SAS, a leading data analytics solutions provider. It can be used to produce repeatable, reliable, and predictive results: 

 * Ask

 * Prepare

 * Explore

 * Model

 * Implement

 * Act

 * Evaluate

The SAS model emphasizes the cyclical nature of their model by visualizing it as an infinity symbol. Its process has seven steps, many of which mirror the other models, like ask, prepare, model, and act. But this process is also a little different; it includes a step after the act phase designed to help analysts evaluate their solutions and potentially return to the ask phase again.

## Project-based data analytics process 
A project-based data analytics process has five simple steps:

 * Identifying the problem

 * Designing data requirements

 * Pre-processing data

 * Performing data analysis

 * Visualizing data

This data analytics project process was developed by Vignesh Prajapati. It doesnâ€™t include the sixth phase, or the act phase. However, it still covers a lot of the same steps described. It begins with identifying the problem, preparing and processing data before analysis, and ends with data visualization.

## Big data analytics process
Authors Thomas Erl, Wajid Khattak, and Paul Buhler proposed a big data analytics process in their book, Big Data Fundamentals: Concepts, Drivers & Techniques. Their process suggests phases divided into nine steps:

 * Business case evaluation

 * Data identification

 * Data acquisition and filtering

 * Data extraction

 * Data validation and cleaning 

 * Data aggregation and representation

 * Data analysis

 * Data visualization

 * Utilization of analysis results

This process appears to have three or four more steps than the previous models. But in reality, they have just broken down what has been referred to as prepare and process into smaller steps. It emphasizes the individual tasks required for gathering, preparing, and cleaning data before the analysis phase.
