Data transformation is the process of changing the dataâ€™s format, structure, or values. As a data analyst, there is a good chance you will need to transform data at some point to make it easier for you to analyze it. 

Data transformation usually involves:
- Adding, copying, or replicating data
- Deleting fields or records
- Standardizing the names of variables
- Renaming, moving, or combining columns in a database
- Joining one set of data with another
- Saving a file in a different format. For example, saving a spreadsheet as a comma separated values (.csv) file.

# Why transform data?

Goals for data transformation might be: 
- Data organization: better organized data is easier to use
- Data compatibility: different applications or systems can then use the same data
- Data migration: data with matching formats can be moved from one system to another
- Data merging: data with the same organization can be merged together
- Data enhancement: data can be displayed with more detailed fields
- Data comparison: apples-to-apples comparisons of the data can then be made
