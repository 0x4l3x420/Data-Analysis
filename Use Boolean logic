# Boolean logic example
Imagine you are shopping for shoes, and are considering certain preferences:

You will buy the shoes only if they are any combination of pink and grey

You will buy the shoes if they are entirely pink, entirely grey, or if they are pink and grey

You will buy the shoes if they are grey, but not if they have any pink

These Venn diagrams illustrate your shoe preferences. AND is the center of the Venn diagram, where two conditions overlap. OR includes either condition. NOT includes only the part of the Venn diagram that doesn't contain the exception.

Operators are symbols that name the operation or calculation to be performed. The operators AND, OR, and NOT can be used to write Boolean statements in programming languages. Whether you are doing a search for new shoes or applying this logic to queries, Boolean logic lets you create multiple conditions to filter your results. Now that you know a little more about Boolean logic, you can start using it!
