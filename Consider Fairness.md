#Consider fairness

| Best practice | Explanation | Example |
|----------|----------|----------|
| Consider all of the available data | Part of your job as a data analyst is to determine what data is going to be useful for your analysis. Often there will be data that isn’t relevant to what you’re focusing on or doesn’t seem to align with your expectations. But you can’t just ignore it; it’s critical to consider all of the available data so that your analysis reflects the truth and not just your own expectations.  | A state’s Department of Transportation is interested in measuring traffic patterns on holidays. At first, they only include metrics related to traffic volumes and the fact that the days are holidays. But the data team realizes they failed to consider how weather on these holidays might also affect traffic volumes. Considering this additional data helps them gain more complete insights.  |
