# What is data modeling?
Data modeling is the process of creating diagrams that visually represent how data is organized and structured.  
These visual representations are called data models.

## Levels of data modeling

1.Conceptual data modeling gives a high-level view of the data structure, such as how data interacts across an organization. For example, a conceptual data model may be used to define the business requirements for a new database. A conceptual data model doesn't contain technical details. 

2.Logical data modeling focuses on the technical details of a database such as relationships, attributes, and entities. For example, a logical data model defines how individual records are uniquely identified in a database. But it doesn't spell out actual names of database tables. That's the job of a physical data model.

3.Physical data modeling depicts how a database operates. A physical data model defines all entities and attributes used; for example, it includes table names, column names, and data types for the database.

## Data-modeling techniques

There are a lot of approaches when it comes to developing data models, but two common methods are the Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) and the Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagram. ERDs are a visual way to understand the relationship between entities in the data model. UML diagrams are very detailed diagrams that describe the structure of a system by showing the system's entities, attributes, operations, and their relationships.
